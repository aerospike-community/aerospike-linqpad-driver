/*
This demonstrates how "Record Display View" works.   

When there are no changes in the schema for a set, only the scanned bins are displayed in the grid. But if there are any changes in the schema (e.g., new bins added or removed) for a recod, a new grid column is added to the display (i.e., "Values") to indicate that this recordâ€™s schema has changed since the last scan of the set.
 
The "Values" column will always indicate that the record schema is different from the scanned Aerospike set.  

You can also programmatically detect these changes by reviwing the value of the "HasDifferentSchema" property of the record.  

The record object (ARecord) has many different properties and methods that can be used to programmatically explore the record and bin atributes. You can, for example, test to see if a bin exists, determine the bin's data type, obtain a bin's value, TTL, etc.  

Note that you can always force a refresh of the cluster by right clicking on the connection object and selecting "Refresh". You can programmaticilly refresh a set by calling the Refresh method on the namespace instance.
